# ADC-DAC-16bit

### Current state of the project
At this time, the project is not tested yet. 

An easy and cheap board to prototypate with two dual channel 16 bit A/D and D/A converters.  
Makes use of I2C to communicate with a microcontroller, see the datasheets for reference.

It uses:
* **MCP3426** 16 bit ADC, dual channel, differential
* **MCP3426** 16 bit DAC, dual channel
